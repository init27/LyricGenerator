there was a girl there was a boy there was a girl there was a boy if they had met they might have found a world of joy but he lived on the morning side of the mountain and she lived on the twilight side of the hill they never met they never kissed they will never know what happiness theyve missed cause he lived on the morningside of the mountain and she lived on the twilight side of the hill for loves a rose that never grows without the kiss of the morning dew and every jack must have a jill to know the thrill of a dream that comes true and you and i are just like they for all we know our love is just a kiss away but you are on the morning side of the mountain and you are on the twilight side of the hill and you and i are just like they for all we know our love is just a kiss away but you are on the morning side of the mountain and you are on the twilight side of the hill there was a girl there was a boy

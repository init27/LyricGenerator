 i like to dream yes yes right between my sound machine on a cloud of sound i drift in the night any place it goes is right goes far flies near to the stars away from herewell you dont know what we can find why dont you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride you dont know what we can see why dont you tell your dreams to me fantasy will set you free close your eyes girl look inside girl let the sound take you awaylast night i held aladdins lamp and so i wished that i could stay before the thing could answer me someone came and took the lamp away i looked around a lousy candles all i foundwell you dont know what we can find why dont you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride well you dont know what we can see why dont you tell your dreams to me fantasy will set you free close your eyes girl look inside girl let the sound take you away

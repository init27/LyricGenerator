 up every mornin just to keep a job i gotta fight my way through the hustling mob sounds of the city poundin in my brain while another day goes down the drainbut its a five oclock world when the whistle blows no one owns a piece of my time and theres a five oclock me inside my clothes thinkin that the world looks fine yeahtradin my time for the pay i get livin on money that i aint made yet ive been goin tryin to make my way while i live for the end of the daycuz its a five oclock world when the whistle blows no one owns a piece of my time and theres a longhaired girl who waits i know to ease my troubled mind yeah oh my lady yeah oh my lady yeah in the shelter of her arms everythings ok when she talks then the world goes slippin away and i know the reason i can still go on when every other reason is gone

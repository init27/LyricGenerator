 time you found time enough to love and i found love enough to hold you so tonight ill stir the fire you feel inside until the flames of love enfold you layin beside you lost in the feeling so glad you opened my door come with me somewhere in the night we will know everything lovers can know youre my song music too magic to end ill play you over and over again lovin so warm movin so right closin our eyes and feelin alive well just go on burnin bright somewhere in the nightyoull sleep when the mornin comes and ill lie and watch you sleepin and youll smile when you dream about the night like its a secret youve been keepin layin beside you lost in the feeling so glad you opened my door youre my song music too magic to end ill play you over and over again lovin so warm movin so right closin our eyes and feelin alive well just go on burnin bright somewhere in the nightwell just go on burnin bright somewhere in the nightwell just go on burnin bright somewhere in the night well just go on burnin bright

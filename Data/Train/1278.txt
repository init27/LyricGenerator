 ive cried through many endless nights just holding my pillow tight then you came into my lonely days with your tender love and sweet ways now i dont know where you come from baby dont know where you been now baby heaven must have sent you into my arms now in the morning when i awake theres a smile upon my face you touch my heart with gladness wiped away all of my sadness oh so long ive needed love right near me a soft voice to cheer me heaven must have sent you baby into my life ooh its heaven in your arms its the sweetness of your charms makes me love you more each day in your arms i wanna stay wanna thank you for the joy youve brought me thank you for the things you taught me thank you for holding me close when i needed you the most now i dont know much about you baby but i know i cant live without you heaven must have sent you honey to love only me its heaven in your arms its the sweetness of your charms makes me love you more each day in your arms i wanna stay

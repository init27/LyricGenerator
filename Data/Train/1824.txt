 meeting you with a view to a kill face to face in secret places feel the chill night fall covers me but you know the plans im making still oversea could it be the whole world opening wide a sacred why a mystery gaping inside the weekends whyuntil we dance into the fire that fatal kiss is all we need dance into the fire to fatal sounds of broken dreams dance into the fire that fatal kiss is all we need dance into the firechoice for you is the view to a kill between the shades assassinations standing still the first crystal tears fall as snowflakes on your body first time in years to drench you skin with lovers rosy stain a chance to find the phoenix for the flame a chance to diebut can we dance into the fire that fatal kiss is all we need dance into the fire to fatal sounds of broken dreams dance into the fire that fatal kiss is all we need dance into the fire when all we see is the view to a kill

 i am thinking of you in my sleepless solitude tonight if its wrong to love you then my heart just wont let me be right cause ive drowned in you and i wont pull through without you by my sideid give my all to have just one more night with you id risk my life to feel your body next to mine cause i cant go on living in the memory of our song id give my all for your love tonightbaby can you feel me imagining im looking in your eyes i can see you clearly vividly emblazoned in my mind and yet youre so far like a distant star im wishing on tonightid give my all to have just one more night with you id risk my life to feel your body next to mine cause i cant go on living in the memory of our song id give my all for your love tonight

 ive been walkin these streets so long singin the same old song i know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of broadway where hustles the name of the game and nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain theres been a load of compromisin on the road to my horizon but im gonna be where the lights are shinin on melike a rhinestone cowboy riding out on a horse in a starspangled rodeo like a rhinestone cowboy getting cards and letters from people i dont even know and offers comin over the phonewell i really dont mind the rain and a smile can hide all the pain but youre down when youre ridin the train thats takin the long way and i dream of the things ill do with a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe therell be a load of compromisin on the road to my horizon but im gonna be where the lights are shinin on melike a rhinestone cowboy riding out on a horse in a starspangled rodeo rhinestone cowboy gettin cards and letters from people i dont even know and offers comin over the phonelike a rhinestone cowboy riding out on a horse in a starspangled rodeolike a rhinestone cowboy gettin card and letters from people i dont even knowlike a rhinestone cowboy riding out on a horse in a starspangled rodeo

 sick and tired of this world theres no more air trippin over myself goin nowhere waiting suffocating no direction i took a diveand on the way down i saw you and you saved me from myself and i wont forget the way you loved me on the way down i almost fell right through but i held onto youive been wondering why its only me have you always been inside waiting to breathe its alright sunlight on my face i wake up and yeah im alivecause on the way down i saw you and you saved me from myself and i wont forget the way you loved me on the way down i almost fell right through but i held onto youi was so afraid of going under but now the weight of the world feels like nothing no nothindown down down youre all i wanted down down down youre all i needed now down down down youre all i wanted youre all i neededand i wont forget the way you loved me all that i wanted all that i needed nowoh on the way down i saw you and you saved me from myself and i wont forget the way you loved me on the way down i almost fell right through but i held onto youdown down down but i held onto you down down down but i held onto you

sometimes in the mornin when shadows are deep i lie here beside you just watching you sleep and sometimes i whisper what im thinking of my cup runneth over with love sometimes in the evening when you do not see i study the small things you do constantly i memorize moments that im fondest of my cup runneth over with love in only a moment we both will be old we wont even notice the world turning cold and so in these moments with sunlight above my cup runneth over with love my cup runneth over with love with love

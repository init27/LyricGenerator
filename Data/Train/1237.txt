 outside the rain begins and it may never end so cry no more on the shore a dream will take us out to sea forever more forever moreclose your eyes and dream and you can be with me neath the waves through the caves of ours long forgotten now were all alone were all aloneclose the window calm the light and it will be all right no need to bother now let it out let it all begin learn how to pretendonce a storys told it cant help but grow old roses do lovers too so cast your seasons to the wind and hold me dear oh hold me dearclose the window calm the light and it will be all right no need to bother now let it out let it all begin alls forgotten now were all aloneoh were all aloneclose the window calm the light and it will be all right no need to bother now let it out let it all begin owe it to the wind my love

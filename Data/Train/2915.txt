 last night i slept alone i stayed at home for the first time since youve been gone babe no friends to understand to lend a helping hand to ease the greatest pain ive ever knownhow you walk away so easily still remains a mystery to me dont you remember that you promised me yes you promised me that youd never leave boybut you went away baby and its such a shame how could you turn you back on me ohchorus if you really dont want me if you dont want me if you really dont need me if you dont need me if you really dont love me tell me who do you loveif you really dont want me if you dont want me if you really dont need me if you dont need me if you really dont love me then who do you lovei gave you babe everything a man could ever need i was there whenever you would call baby but somehow your feelings changed and you dont act the same i guess youre not the man that i once knew at allhow you walk away so easily still remains a mystery to me dont you remember that you promised me yes you promised me that youd never leave boynow the love is gone babe tell me what went wrong how could you leave me hanging on oh babychorusi once was blind but baby now im seeing that im not the one who can fill your every need i painted a picture so clear its reality now i know yes i know that youre not the one for me ohhhhh babychorushow you walk away so easily still remains a mystery to me dont you remember that you promised me yes you promised me that youd never leave boyhow could you walk away from me baby if you promised youd never leave been so long since youve been gone the greatest thing ive ever knownchorus

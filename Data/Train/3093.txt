 all alone on a sunday morning outside i see the rain is falling inside im slowly dying but the rain will hide my crying crying cryingand you dont you know my tears will burn the pillow set this place on fire cause im tired of your lie all i needed was a simple hello but the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cryi i gave you my love in vain my body never knew such pleasure my heart never knew such pain and you you leave me so confused now im all cried out over you ooh crying over you over you yeahnever wanted to see things your way had to go astray for why was i such a fool now i see that the grass is greener is it too late for me to find my way home how could i be so wrong yeahleaving me all alone dont you know my tears will cause an inferno romance of these flames why should i take the blame you were the one who left me neglected apology not accepted add me to the broken hearts youve collectedi gave you all of me how was i to know you would weaken so easily i i dont know what to do now im all cried out over youi gave you my love in vain my body never knew such pleasure my heart never knew such pain and you you left me so confused now im all cried out now im all cried out over youplease forgive me please forgive me oh please forgive me

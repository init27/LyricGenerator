when the deep purple falls over sleepy garden walls and the stars begin to twinkle in the sky in the mist of a memory you wander back to me breathing my name with a sigh in the still of the night once again i hold you tight though youre gone your love lives on when moonlight beams and as long as my heart will beat sweet lovers well always meet here in my deep purple dreams when the deep purple falls over sleepy garden walls and the stars begin to twinkle in the sky in the mist of a memory you wander back to me breathing my name with a sigh in the still of the night once again i hold you tight though youre gone your love lives on when moonlight beams and as long as my heart will beat sweet lovers well always meet here in my deep purple dreams and as long as my heart will beat sweet lovers well always meet here in my deep purple dreams here in my deep purple dreams here in my deep purple dreams

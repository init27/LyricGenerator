 sometimes its hard to make things clear i know when to face the truth and i know when the moment is here ill open my heart and show you inside my love has no pride i feel with you ive got nothing to hide so open your eyes and see who i am and not who you want for me to be i am only myself myselfi dont wanna lose you now were gonna get through somehow i dont wanna lose you now forever baby i finally found the courage to stand my ground but if you want me ill be around foreverwe all make mistakes we all lose our way but we stood the test of time and i hope thats the way it will stay its all up to you to tell me to go cause it wont be me to walk away when youre all that i know and i know thati dont wanna lose you now were gonna get through somehow i dont wanna lose you now forever never baby i finally found the courage to stand my ground but if you want me ill be around forever forever yea yea

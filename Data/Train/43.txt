original is an instrumental music vocals recorded by salena jones the trees join hands and say hello and suddenly evrywhere we go the sun beams through in fun the  leaves form patterns like a heart and whisper forever never part  be true cause  i love you shadows write words of love across our path birds sing how lucky those whose love just grows together blades of grass stand on and on and chatter together in a calm  thats green and so serene a   memry of our walk   of love in a dream a stream goes by reflecting a message from the sky above and here and there we look around to see other lovers who have found  their way crickets tap out their symphony  in code rabbits run helter skelter finding shelter here and flowers swaying in the breeze look up to the branches of the trees and  sing as  birds take wing all this is true cause i love you

 i knew it from the start you would break my heart but you still i had to play this painful part you rapped me round your itty bitty finger with your magic smile you kept me hangin on a lovers cross a while you put your spell on me took my breath away but there was nothin i could do to make you stay im gonna miss you all the love i feel for you nothing could make me change my point of view oh girl im gonna miss you babychorus giving all the love i feel for you couldnt make you change your point of view youre leavin now im sittin here im wastin my time i just dont know what i should doits a tragedy for me to see the dream is over and i never will forget the day we met girl im gonna miss youlike a honey bee you took the best of me now i cant erase those memories like a fairy tale you are so unreal you left a scar thats so hard to heal when you had a taste of paradise back on earth can feel as cold as ice im gonna miss you i miss you

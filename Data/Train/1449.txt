 in my life ive felt so self assured but suddenly its all changed shes a cloud that hangs above my world and i find myself wondring in the rain and now i cant go oncause i am lost living inside myself living inside this shell living outside your love i am lost somewhere inside my own dreams afraid of what life really means living without your lovei need a guiding light to shine on my darkest days i was young and time was on my side but like a fool i let it slip away and now those days are goneand i am lost living inside myself living inside this shell living outside your love i am lost somewhere inside my own dreams afraid of what life really means living without your lovein my life ive felt so selfassured but oh how all the seasons change and now im not that strongcause i am lost living inside myself living inside this hell living outside your love i am lost somewhere inside my own dreams afraid of what life really means living without your lovei am lost living inside myself living inside this shell living outside your love i am lost

wasted days and wasted nights i have left for you behind for you dont belong to me your heart belongs to someone else why should i keep loving you when i know that youre not true and why should i call your name when youre the blame for making me blue dont you remember the day that you went away and left me i was so lonely prayed for you only my love why should i keep loving you when i know that youre not true and why should i call your name when youre the blame for making me blue dont you remember the day that you went away and left me i was so lonely prayed for you only my love why should i keep loving you when i know that youre not true and why should i call your name when youre the blame for making me blue

 oceans apart day after day and i slowly go insane i hear your voice on the line but it doesnt stop the painif i see you next to never how can we say foreverwherever you go whatever you do i will be right here waiting for you whatever it takes or how my heart breaks i will be right here waiting for youi took for granted all the times that i thought would last somehow i hear the laughter i taste the tears but i cant get near you nowoh cant you see it baby youve got me going crazywherever you go whatever you do i will be right here waiting for you whatever it takes or how my heart breaks i will be right here waiting for youi wonder how we can survive this romance but in the end if im with you ill take the chanceoh cant you see it baby youve got me going crazywherever you go whatever you do i will be right here waiting for you whatever it takes or how my heart breaks i will be right here waiting for you waiting for you

now when youre feelin low and the fish wont bite you need a little bit o soul to put you right you gotta make like you wanna kneel and pray and then a little bit o soul will come your way now when your girl is gone and youre broke in two you need a little bit o soul to see you through and when you raise the roof with your rock n roll youll get a lot more kicks with a little bit o soul and when your party falls cause aint nobody groovin a little bit of soul and it really starts movin yeah and when youre in a mess and you feel like cryin just remember this little song of mine and as you go through life tryin to reach your goal just remember what i said about a little bit o soul a little bit o soul yeah a little bit o soul

hey girl what ya doin down there dancin alone every night while i live right above you i can hear your music playin i can feel your body swayin one floor below me you dont even know me i love you oh my darling knock three times on the ceiling if you want me twice on the pipe if the answer is no oh my sweetness means youll meet me in the hallway twice on the pipe means you aint gonna show if you look out your window tonight pull in the string with the note thats attached to my heart read how many times i saw you how in my silence i adored you and only in my dreams did that wall between us come apart oh my darling knock three times on the ceiling if you want me twice on the pipe if the answer is no oh my sweetness means youll meet me in the hallway twice on the pipe means you aint gonna show read how many times i saw you how in my silence i adored you and only in my dreams did that wall between us come apart oh my darling knock three times on the ceiling if you want me twice on the pipe if the answer is no oh my sweetness means youll meet me in the hallway twice on the pipe means you aint gonna show

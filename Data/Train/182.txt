shapes of things before my eyes just teach me to despise will time make men more wise here within my lonely frame my eyes just heard my brain but will it seem the same come tomorrow will i be older come tomorrow may be a soldier come tomorrow may i be bolder than today now the trees are almost green but will they still be seen when time and tide have been fallin into your passing hands please dont destroy these lands dont make them desert sands come tomorrow will i be older come tomorrow may be a soldier come tomorrow may i be bolder than today soon i hope that i will find thoughts deep within my mind that wont displace my kind

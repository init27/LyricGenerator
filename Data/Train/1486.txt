 im shouting all about live while they treated you like a dog when you were the one who had made it so clear all those years ago im talking all about how to give they dont act with much honesty but you point the way to the truth when you say all you need is loveliving with good and bad i always looked up to you now were left cold and sad by someone the devils best friend someone who offended all were living in a bad dream theyve forgotten all about mankind and you were the one they backed up to the wallall those years ago you were the one who imagined it all all those years ago all those years ago all those years agodeep in the darkest night i send out a prayer to you now in the world of light where the spirit free of the lies and all else that we despised theyve forgotten all about god hes the only reason we exist yet you were the one that they said was so weird all those years ago you said it all though not many had ears all those years ago you had control of our smiles and our tears all those years ago

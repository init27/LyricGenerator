 even though the moment passed me by i still cant turn away all the dreams you never thought youd lose got tossed along the way letters that you never meant to send lost or thrown away now were grown up orphans that never knew their names we dont belong to no one thats a shame if you could hide inside me maybe for awhile and i wont tell no one your name and i wont tell em your namescars are souvenirs you never lose the past is never far and did you lose yourself somewhere out there did you get to be a star dont make you sad to know that life is more than who you are grew up way too fast and now theres nothing to believe reruns all become our history a tired song keeps playing on a tired radio and i wont tell em your name and i wont tell em your name and i wont tell em your namei think about you all the time but i dont need the same its lonely where you are come back down and i wont tell em your name

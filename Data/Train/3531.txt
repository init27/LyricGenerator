 i need a sign to let me know youre here all of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere i need to know that things are gonna look up cause i feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cupwhen there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head when you can feel the world shake from the words that are saidand im calling all angels and im calling all you angelsand i wont give up if you dont give up i wont give up if you dont give up i wont give up if you dont give up i wont give up if you dont give upi need a sign to let me know youre here cause my tv set just keeps it all from being clear i want a reason for the way things have to be i need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of meand im calling all angels and im calling all you angelswhen children have to play inside so they dont disappear while private eyes solve marriage lies cause we dont talk for years and football teams are kissing queens and losing sight of having dreams in a world where what we want is only what we want until its oursand im calling all angels and im calling all you angelsand im calling all angels i wont give up if you dont give up i wont give up if you dont give up and im calling all you angels i wont give up if you dont give up i wont give up if you dont give upcalling all you angels i wont give up if you dont give up calling all you angels i wont give up if you dont give up calling all you angels i wont give up if you dont give up

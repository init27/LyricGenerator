time will never lose memories we choose choices that weve made for love voices in my head they call me away you were right beside me im in love maybe i should have known it maybe i should have seen but i stayed lost in my dreams now that youre gone chorus i remember holding you feeling felt so right now i find im reaching out in the middle of the night all those things i should have said now my chance is gone all alone im reaching out even though i know its wrong so wrong we will never know what my heart will never show i will keep it all inside somehow when i tried you knew that i lied in my heart i feel untrue maybe i should have known it maybe i should have seen but im still lost in my dreams now that youre gone repeat chorus oh i know i know i know i know its wrong all the times i should have seen everything you meant to me now i only hold you in my dreams repeat chorus i remember holding you i remember holding you i know i know i know i know its wrong i remember holding you i remember holding you i remember holding you feeling felt so right felt so right all those things i should have said oh no no yeah yeah i remember holding you

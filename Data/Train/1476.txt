written by john mellencamp well our hearts beat like thunder i dont know why they dont explode you got your hands in my back pockets and sam cookes singin on the radio you say that im the boy who can make it all come true well im tellinya that i dont know if i know what to do chorus you say thats all right hold tight well i dont even know if im doin this right well all right hold tight we can stay out all day or we can run around all night well all night all night well its time to go home and i aint even done with the night well i dont know no good comeons and i dont know no cool lines i feel the heat of your frustration i know its burnin you up deep down inside you say that im the boy who can make it all come true well im tellin ya that i dont know if i know what to do chorus

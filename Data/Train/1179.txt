 you ask me if i love you and i choke on my reply id rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a liefor who am i to judge you in what you say or do im only just beginning to see the real youchorus and sometimes when we touch the honestys too much and i have to close my eyes and hide i want to hold you till i die till we both break down and cry i want to hold you till the fear in me subsidesromance and all its strategy leaves me battling with my pride but through the insecurity some tenderness survives im just another writer still trapped within my truth a hesitant prizefighter still trapped within my youthchorusat times id like to break you and drive you to your knees at times id like to break through and hold you endlessly at times i understand you and i know how hard you try ive watched while love commands you and ive watched love pass you by at times i think were drifters still searching for a friend a brother or a sister but then the passion flares againchorus

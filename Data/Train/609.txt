here comes that rainy day feeling again and soon my tears they will be falling like rain it always seems to be a monday left over memories of sunday always spent with you before the clouds appeared and took away my sunshine here comes that rainy day feeling again and ill be dreaming of you baby in vain your face is always on my mind girl i hoping soon youre gonna find your way back tome cause if you say youll stay the rainy days will go away misty morning eyes im trying to disguise the way i feel but i just cant hide it people seem to know the loneliness will show im thinking of my pride but breaking up inside here comes that rainy day feeling again and soon my tears they will be falling like rain it always seems to be a monday left over memories of sunday always spent with you before the clouds appeared and took away my sunshine here comes that rainy day feeling again here comes that rainy day feeling again here comes that rainy day feeling again

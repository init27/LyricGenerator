 you look in my eyes and i get emotional inside i know its crazy but you still can touch my heart and after all this time youd think that i wouldnt feel the same but time melts into nothing and nothings changedi still believe someday you and me will find ourselves in love again i had a dream someday you and me will find ourselves in love againeach day of my life im filled with all the joy i could find you know that i im not the desperate type if theres one spark of hope left in my grasp ill hold it with both hands its worth the risk of burning to have a second chanceno no no no no no i need you baby i still believe that we can be together no no if we believe that true love never has to end then we must know that we will love againi still believe someday you and me will find ourselves in love again i had a dream you and me will find ourselves in love againi still believe someday you and me will find ourselves in love again i had a dream someday you and me will find ourselves in love again

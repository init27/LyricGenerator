you i dont know what to say you take my breath away youre every song i sing youre the music that i play and you take my breath away you you smile and its okay you take my breath away like water from a stream on a sizzling summer day oh you take my breath away there are words for the magic of a sunrise only none of them will due for you you take my breath away and i dont know what to say cause you take my breath away you you take my breath away and i dont know what to say cause you take my breath away you take my breath away you take my breath away you take my breath away oh you take my breath away

 my world is empty without you babe my world is empty without you babe and as i go my way alone i find it hard for me to carry on i need your strength i need your tender touch i need the love my dear i miss so muchmy world is empty without you babe my world is empty without you babe from this old world i try to hide my face but from this loneliness theres no hiding place inside this cold and empty house i dwell in darkness with memories i know so welli need your love more than before i can hardly carry on anymore my world is empty without you babe without you babe without you babe my mind and soul have felt like this since love between us no more exist and each time that darkness falls if finds me alone with these four wallsmy world is empty without you babe without you babe without you babe without you babe without you babe without you babe without you babe without you babe

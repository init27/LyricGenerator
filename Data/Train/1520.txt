 sometimes i feel ive got to run away ive got to get away from the pain that you drive into the heart of me the love we share seems to go nowhere and ive lost my light for i toss and turn i cant sleep at nightonce i ran to you i ran now ill run from you this tainted love youve given i give you all a boy could give you take my tears and thats not nearly all oh tainted love tainted lovenow i know ive got to run away ive got to get away you dont really want it any more from me to make things right you need someone to hold you tight and youll think love is to pray but im sorry i dont pray that wayonce i ran to you i ran now ill run from you this tainted love youve given i give you all a boy could give you take my tears and thats not nearly all oh tainted love tainted love

take the ribbon from my hair shake it loose and let it fall layin soft against your skin like the shadow on the wall come and lay down by my side till the early mornin light all im takin is your time help me make it through the night i dont care whats right or wrong and i wont try to understand let the devil take tomorrow lord tonight i need a friend yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrows out of sight and its sad to be alone help me make it through the night and its sad to be alone help me make it through the night i dont want to be alone help me make it through the night

 the heart of the city street was beating light from the neons turned the dark to day we were too hot to think of sleeping we had to get out before the magic got awaywe were running with the night playing in the shadows just you and i till the morning light we were running running with the night ohyou were looking so good girl heads were turning you and me on the town ooh we let it all hang out the fire was in us we were burning we were gonna go all the way and we never had a doubtwe were running with the night playing in the shadows just you and i till the morning light we were running running with the night ohwe were so in love you and me on the boulevard wild and free giving all we got we laid it down taking every shot we took the townwe were running with the night playing in the shadows just you and i and it was so right girl it was so right

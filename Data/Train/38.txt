 baby im yours and ill be yours until the stars fall from the sky yours until the rivers all run dry in other words until i die baby im yours and ill be yours until the sun no longer shines yours until the poets run out of rhyme in other words until the end of time im gonna stay right here by your side do my best to keep you satisfied nothing in this world can drive me away cause every day youll hear me say baby im yours and ill be yours until two and two is three yours until the mountain crumbles to the sea in other words until eternity baby im yours till the stars fall from the sky baby im yours till the rivers all run dry baby im yours till the poets run out of rhyme baby im yours

 through the mirror of my mind time after time i see reflections of you and mereflections of the way life used to be reflections of the love you took from meoh im all alone now no love to shield me trapped in a world thats a distorted realityhappiness you took from me and left me alone with only memoriesthrough the mirror of my mind through these tears that im crying reflects a hurt i cant control cause although youre gone i keep holding on to the happy times oh when you were mineas i peer through the window of lost time looking over my yesterdays and all the love i gave all in vain all the love all the love that ive wasted all the tears all the tears that ive tasted all in vainthrough the hollow of my tears i see a dream thats lost from the hurt that you have causedeverywhere i turn seems like everything i see reflects the love that used to bein you i put all my faith and trust right before my eyes my world has turned to dustafter all the nights i sat alone and wept just a handful of promises are all thats left of loving youreflections of the way life used to be reflections of the love you took from mein you i put all my faith and trust right before my eyes my world has turned to dust

 got a wife and kids in baltimore jack i went out for a ride and i never went back like a river that dont know where its flowing i took a wrong turn and i just kept goingchorus everybodys got a hungry heart everybodys got a hungry heart lay down your money and you play your part everybodys got a hungry hearti met her in a kingstown bar we fell in love i knew it had to end we took what we had and we ripped it apart now here i am down in kingstown againchoruseverybody needs a place to rest everybody wants to have a home dont make no difference what nobody says aint nobody like to be alonechorus

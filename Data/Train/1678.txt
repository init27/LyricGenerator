 now the mist across the window hides the lines but nothing hides the color of the lights that shine electricity so fine look and dry your eyeswe so tired of all the darkness in our lives with no more angry words to say can come alive get into a car and drive to the other side me babe steppin out into the night into the light you babe steppin out into the night into the lightwe are young but getting old before our time well leave the tv and the radio behind dont you wonder what well find steppin out tonightyou can dress in pink and blue just like a child and in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile well be there in just a while if you follow me me babe steppin out into the night into the light you babe steppin out into the night into the lightme babe steppin out into the night into the light you babe steppin out into the night into the lightme babe steppin out into the night into the light

 the love between the two of us was dying and it got so bad i knew i had to leave but halfway down that highway when i turned around i saw my little daughter running after me cryingdaddy dont you walk so fast daddy dont you walk so fast daddy slow down some cause youre makin me run daddy dont you walk so fastnow it broke my heart to tell my little daughter that her daddy had to run to catch a train she had no way of knowin i was leavin home for good i turned around and there she was again as she said to medaddy dont you walk so fast daddy dont you walk so fast daddy slow down some cause youre makin me run daddy dont you walk so fastif only for the sake of my sweet daughter i just had to turn back home right there and then and try to start a new life with the mother of my child i couldnt bear to hear those words again she cried and saiddaddy dont you walk so fast my daughter cried daddy dont you walk so fast daddy slow down some cause youre makin me run daddy dont you walk so fast daddy slow down some cause youre makin me run oh daddy dont you walk so fast

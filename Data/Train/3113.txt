kiss me out of the bearded barley nightly beside the green green grass swing swing swing the spinning step you wear those shoes and i will wear that dress oh kiss me beneath the milky twilight lead me out on the moonlit floor lift your open hand strike up the band and make the fireflies dance silver moons sparkling so kiss me kiss me down by the broken tree house swing me upon its hanging tire bring bring bring your flowered hat well take the trail marked on your fathers map oh kiss me beneath the milky twilight lead me out on the moonlit floor lift your open hand strike up the band and make the fireflies dance silver moons sparkling so kiss me kiss me beneath the milky twilight lead me out on the moonlit floor lift your open hand strike up the band and make the fireflies dance silver moons sparkling so kiss me so kiss me so kiss me so kiss me

 see the stone set in your eyes see the thorn twist in your side i wait for you sleight of hand and twist of fate on a bed of nails she makes me wait and i wait without youwith or without you with or without youthrough the storm we reach the shore you give it all but i want more and im waiting for youwith or without you with or without you i cant live with or without youand you give yourself away and you give yourself away and you give and you give and you give yourself awaymy hands are tied my body bruised shes got me with nothing to win and nothing left to loseand you give yourself away and you give yourself away and you give and you give and you give yourself awaywith or without you with or without you i cant live with or without you ohwith or without you with or without you i cant live with or without youwith or without you

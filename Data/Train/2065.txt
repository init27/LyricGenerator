 i hold you in my arms as the band plays what are those words whispered baby just as you turn away i saw you last night out on the edge of town i wanna read your mind to know just what ive got in this new thing ive found so tell me what i see when i look in your eyes is that you baby or just a brilliant disguisei heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow i saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow well ive tried so hard baby but i just cant see what a woman like you is doing with me so tell me who i see when i look in your eyes is that you baby or just a brilliant disguisenow look at me baby struggling to do everything right and then it all falls apart when out go the lights im just a lonely pilgrim i walk this world in wealth i want to know if its you i dont trust cause i damn sure dont trust myselfnow you play the loving woman ill play the faithful man but just dont look too close into the palm of my hand we stood at the alter the gypsy swore our future was right but come the wee wee hours well maybe baby the gypsy lied so when you look at me you better look hard and look twice is that me baby or just a brilliant disguise

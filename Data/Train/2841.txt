you gave me life you gave me all my hopes and dreams oh sweet mama and now i realize all the joy youve put inside of me i i miss you and i want you to know that i i i miss you i really miss you mama i i miss you deep in my heart im lonely without you mama i i miss you i want you to know ever since youve been gone im feeling so all alone all by myself i need your help mama so many days memories of your face lingers on i i miss you want you to know that i i miss you sometimes the world feels like its on my shoulders i i miss you i still remember the day you said son youve got to be strong youve got to hold on i i miss you hold on now im holding on i i miss you youve put the joy in my heart i dont mind telling the world i i miss you everywhere i go oh when i when i look in the mirror i i miss you all i do is see reflections of your eyes i i miss you sunday morning sunday morning make us breakfast in the morning we used to sit at the table say our prayers together oh mama the tears run down my face i i miss you cause theres no one to take your place i i miss you oh mama i miss you i miss you i miss you i miss you i love you mama

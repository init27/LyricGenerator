 if i can reach the stars pull one down for you shine it on my heart so you could see the truth that this love i have inside is everything it seems but for now i find its only in my dreamsand i can change the world i will be the sunlight in your universe you would think my love was really something good baby if i could change the worldif i could be king even for a day id take you as my queen id have it no other way and our love would rule this kingdom we had made till then id be a fool wishing for the daythat i can change the world i would be the sunlight in your universe you would think my love was really something good baby if i could change the world baby if i could change the world

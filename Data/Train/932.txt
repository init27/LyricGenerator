hey everybodys talkin about the good old days right everybody the good old days the good old days well lets talk about the good old days come to think of it as as bad as we think they are these will become the good old days for our children but why dont we try to remember that kind of september when life was slow and oh so mellow try to remember and if you remember then follow oh why does it seem the past is always better we look back and think the winters were warmer the grass was greener the skies were bluer and smiles were bright can it be that it was all so simple then or has time rewritten every line and if we had the chance to do it all again tell me would we could we memories like the corners of my mind misty watercolor memories of the way we were scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind smiles we gave to one another for the way we were oh can it be that it was all so simple then or has time rewritten every line and if we had the chance to do it all again tell me would we could we memories may be beautiful and yet whats too painful to remember we simply choose to forget so its the laughter we will remember whenever we remember the way we were remember the way we were

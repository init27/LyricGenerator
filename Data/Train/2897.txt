 it doesnt matter what i say so long as i sing with inflection that makes you feel ill convey some inner truth or vast reflection but ive said nothing so far and i can keep it up for as long as it takes and it dont matter who you are if im doing my job then its your resolve that breaksbecause the hook brings you back i aint tellin you no lie the hook brings you back on that you can relythere is something amiss i am being insincere in fact i dont mean any of this still my confession draws you near to confuse the issue i refer to familiar heroes from long ago no matter how much peter loved her what made the pan refuse to growwas that the hook brings you back i aint tellin you no lie the hook brings you back on that you can relysuck it in suck it in suck it in if youre rin tin tin or anne boleyn make a desperate move or else youll win and then begin to see what youre doing to me this mtv is not for free its so pc its killing meso desperately i sing to thee of love sure but also rage and hate and pain and fear of self and i cant keep these feeling on the shelf ive tried well no in fact i lied could be financial suicide but ive got too much pride inside to hide or slide ill do as ill decide and let it ride till until ive died and only then shall i abide by this tide of catchy little tunes of hip three minute diddies i wanna bust all your balloonsi wanna burn of all your cities to the ground but ive found i will not mess around unless i play then hey i will go on all day hear what i say i have a prayer to pray thats really all this was and when im feeling stuck and need a buck i dont rely on luckbecause the hook brings you back i aint tellin you no lie the hook on that you can rely

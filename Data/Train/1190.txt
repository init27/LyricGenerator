 ive been here all your life watching your crying game you were the heaven in my lonely world and he was your sun and your rain i was losing you before i ever held you tight before you ever held me in your arms and i wont make you blue and maybe an everlasting love will doive got an everlasting love so tall so wide so high above the rumble of thunder down below its your love i need its the only show and its you on an everlasting dream can take us anywhere are the tears of yesterday we killed the pain we blew away the memories of the tears we cried and an everlasting love will never dietake me out of the cold give me what ive waited for if its the pleasure of taking my heart that you need then it only makes me love you more i was yours before the stars were born and you were mine i could have saved you all the pain you knew and i wont make you cry and maybe an everlasting love can tryive got an everlasting love so tall so wide so high above the rumble of thunder down below its your love i need its the only show and its you on an everlasting dream can take us anywhere are the tears of yesterday we killed the pain we blew away the memories of the tears we cried and an everlasting love will never die repeat

the whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight are rolling by like thunder now as i look in your eyes i hold on to your body and feel each move you make your voice is warm and tender a love that i could not forsake cause i am your lady and you are my man whenever you reach for me ill do all that i can even though there may be times it seems im far away never wonder where i am cause i am always by your side cause i am your lady and you are my man whenever you reach for me ill do all that i can were heading for something somewhere ive never been sometimes i am frightened but im ready to learn of the power of love the sound of your heart beating made it clear suddenly the feeling that i cant go on is light years away cause i am your lady and you are my man whenever you reach for me im gonna do all that i can were heading for something somewhere ive never been sometimes i am frightened but im ready to learn of the power of love the power of love incomprehensible the power of love

 we both lie silently still in the dead of the night although we both lie close together we feel miles apart inside was it something i said or something i did did my words not come out right though i tried not to hurt you though i tried but i guess thats why they sayevery rose has its thorn just like every night has its dawn just like every cowboy sings his sad sad song every rose has its thornyeah it does i listen to your favorite song playing on the radio hear the dj say loves a game of easy come and easy go but i wonder does he know has it ever felt like this and i know that youd be here right now if i could have let you know somehow i guessevery rose has its thorn just like every night has its dawn just like every cowboy sings his sad sad song every rose has its thornthough its been a while now i can still feel so much pain like the knife that cuts you the wound heals but the scar that scar remains i know i could have saved our love that night if id known what to say instead if making love we both made our separate ways now he found somebody new and that i never meant that much to you to hear that tears me up inside and to see you cuts me like a knifei guess every rose has its thorn just like every night has its dawn just like every cowboy sings his sad sad song every rose has its thorn

 i waited til i saw the sun i dont know why i didnt come i left you by the house of fun i dont know why i didnt come i dont know why i didnt comewhen i saw the break of day i wished that i could fly away instead of kneeling in the sand catching teardrops in my handmy heart is drenched in wine but youll be on my mind foreverout across the endless sea i would die in ecstasy but ill be a bag of bones driving down the road alonemy heart is drenched in wine but youll be on my mind foreversomething has to make you run i dont know why i didnt come i feel as empty as a drum i dont know why i didnt come i dont know why i didnt come

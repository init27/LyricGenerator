somewhere my love there will be songs to sing although the snow covers the hope of spring somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold and there are dreams all that your heart can hold someday well meet again my love someday whenever the spring breaks through youll come to me out of the long ago warm as the wind soft as the kiss of snow till then my sweet think of me now and then god speed my love till you are mine again lara my own think of me now and then god speed my love till you are mine again mine again

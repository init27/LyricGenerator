nobody on the road nobody on the beach i feel it in the air the summers out of reach empty lake empty streets the sun goes down alone im drivin by your house though i know youre not home but i can see you your brown skin shinin in the sun you got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on baby and i can tell you my love for you will still be strong after the boys of summer have gone i never will forget those nights i wonder if it was a dream remember how you made me crazy remember how i made you scream now i dont understand what happened to our love but baby im gonna get you back im gonna show you what im made of i can see you your brown skin shinin in the sun i see you walkin real slow and youre smilin at everyone i can tell you my love for you will still be strong after the boys of summer have gone out on the road today i saw a deadhead sticker on a cadillac a little voice inside my head said dont look back you can never look back i thought i knew what love was what did i know those days are gone forever i should just let them go but i can see you your brown skin shinin in the sun you got that top pulled down and that radio on baby and i can tell you my love for you will still be strong after the boys of summer have gone i can see you your brown skin shining in the sun you got that hair slicked back and those wayfarers on baby i can tell you my love for you will still be strong after the boys of summer have gone

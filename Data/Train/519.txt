 i just cant help believing when she smiles up soft and gentle with a trace of misty morning and a promise of tomorrow in her eyesand i just cant help believing when shes lying close beside me and my heart beats with the rhythm of her sighthis time the girl is gonna stay this time the girl is gonna stay for more than just a dayi just cant help believing when she slips her hand in my hand and it feels so small and helpless that my fingers fold around it like a gloveand i just cant help believing when shes whispering her magic and her tears are shining honey sweet with lovethis time the girl is gonna stay this time the girl is gonna stay for more than just a dayfor more than just a day i just cant help believing i just cant help believing i just cant help believing

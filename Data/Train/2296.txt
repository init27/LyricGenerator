 look at this face i know the years are showing look at this life i still dont know where its goingchorus i dont know much but i know i love you and that may be all i need to knowlook at these eyes they never see what matters look at these dreams so beat and so batteredchorus i dont know much but i know i love you that may be all i need to knowso many questions still left unanswered so much ive never broken through and when i feel you near me sometimes i see so clearly the only truth ill ever know is me and youlook at this man so blessed with inspiration look at this soul still searching for salvationchorus i dont know much but i know i love you and that may be all i need to knowinstrumentalchorus i dont know much but i know i love you that may be all i need to knowchorus i dont know much but i know i love you that may be all there is to know

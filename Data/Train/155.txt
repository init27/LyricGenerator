 coming on strong coming on strong i can feel the heartaches coming on strongi can feel the teardrops the pain and sorrow ever since youve been gone theyve been coming on strongpain come on in hello sorrow i see youre back again teardrops glad you dropped by cause you can help drown my prideand since youre here the time seems to fly to let you know youre gonna be with me till i lose my mindbut youve been gone much too long and i can feel the heartaches coming on strongonly thing you left me was misery for company and memories of a love gone wrong that keep coming on strongcoming on strong coming on strong coming on strong coming on strong coming on strong

 so many nights id sit by my window waiting for someone to sing me his songso many dreams ive kept deep inside me alone in the dark but now youve come alongchorusand you light up my life you give me hope to carry onyou light up my days and fill my nights with songrolling at sea adrift on the waters could it be finally im turning for homefinally a chance to say hey i love you never again to be all alonechorus x2it cant be wrong when it feels so right cause you you light up my life

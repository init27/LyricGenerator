 another day is at end mama says shes tired again no one can even begin to tell her i hardly know what to say but maybe its better that way is papa were hereim sure hed tell her shannon is gone i hope shes drifting out to sea she always loved to swim away maybe shell find an island with a shady tree just like the one in our backyard mama tried hard to pretend things would get better again somehow shes keeping it all inside her but finally the tears fill our eyes and i know that somewhere tonight she knows how much we really miss her

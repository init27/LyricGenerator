 starry starry night paint your palette blue and gray look out on a summers day with eyes that know the darkness in my soulshadows on the hills sketch the trees and the daffodils catch the breeze and the winter chills in colors on the snowy linen landnow i understand what you tried to say to me and how you suffered for your sanity and how you tried to set them free they would not listen they did not know how perhaps theyll listen nowstarry starry night flaming flowers that brightly blaze swirling clouds in violet haze reflect in vincents eyes of china bluecolors changing hue morning fields of amber grain weathered faces lined in pain are soothed beneath the artists loving handnow i understand what you tried to say to me and how you suffered for your sanity and how you tried to set them free they would not listen they did not know how perhaps theyll listen nowfor they could not love you but still your love was true and when no hope was left inside on that starry starry nightyou took your life as lovers often do but i could have told you vincent this world was never meant for one as beautiful as youstarry starry night portraits hung in empty halls frame less heads on nameless walls with eyes that watch the world and cant forgetlike the strangers that youve met the ragged men in ragged clothes the silver thorn of bloody rose lie crushed and broken on the virgin snownow i think i know what you tried to say to me and how you suffered for your sanity and how you tried to set them free they would not listen theyre not listening still perhaps they never will

 you called me from the room in your hotel all full of romance for someone that you met and telling me how sorry you were leaving so soon and that you miss me sometimes when youre alone in your room do i feel lonely tooyou have no right to ask me how i feel you have no right to speak to me so kind i cant go on just holding on to time now that were living living separate liveswell i held on to let you go and if you lost your love for me well you never let it show never let it show there was no way to compromise so now were living living separate livesooh its so typical love leads to isolation so you build that wall build that wall yes you build that wall build that wall and you make it stronger

its sad to think were not gonna make it and its gotten to the point where we just cant fake it for some ungodly reason we just wont let it die i guess neither one of us wants to be the first to say goodbye i keep wondering what im gonna do without you and i guess you must be wondering that same thing too so we go on go on together living a lie because neither one of us wants to be the first to say goodbye everytime i find the nerve everytime i find the nerve to say im leaving memories those old memories get in my way lord knows its only me oh he knows its me that im deceiving when it comes to saying goodbye thats a simple word that i just cannot say there can be no way there can be no way this can have a happy ending no no so we just go on hurting and pretending and convincing ourselves to give it just one more try because neither one of us wants to be the first to say neither one of us wants to be the first to say neither one of us wants to be the first to say farewell my love goodbye goodbye

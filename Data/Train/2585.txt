 call you up in the middle of the night like a firefly without a light you were there like a slow torch burning i was a key that could use a little turningso tired that i couldnt even sleep so many secrets i couldnt keep promised myself i wouldnt weep one more promise i couldnt keepit seems no one can help me now im in too deep theres no way out this time i have really led myself astrayrunaway train never going back wrong way on a one way track seems like i should be getting somewhere somehow im neither here nor therecan you help me remember how to smile make it somehow all seem worthwhile how on earth did i get so jaded lifes mystery seems so fadedi can go where no one else can go i know what no one else knows here i am just drownin in the rain with a ticket for a runaway traineverything is cut and dry day and night earth and sky somehow i just dont believe itrunaway train never going back wrong way on a one way track seems like i should be getting somewhere somehow im neither here nor therebought a ticket for a runaway train like a madman laughin at the rain little out of touch little insane just easier than dealing with the painrunaway train never comin back wrong way on a one way track seems like i should be getting somewhere somehow im neither here nor thererunaway train never comin back runaway train tearin up the track runaway train burnin in my veins runaway but it always seems the same

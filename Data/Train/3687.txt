 i walk a lonely road the only one that i have ever known dont know where it goes but its home to me and i walk alonei walk this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams where the city sleeps and im the only one and i walk alonei walk alone i walk alonei walk alone i walk amy shadows only one that walks beside me my shallow hearts the only thing thats beating sometimes i wish someone out there will find me till then i walk aloneahah ahah ahah aahah ahah ahah ahahim walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind on the border line of the edge and where i walk aloneread between the lines whats fucked up and everythings all right check my vital signs to know im still alive and i walk alonei walk alone i walk alonei walk alone i walk amy shadows only one that walks beside me my shallow hearts the only thing thats beating sometimes i wish someone out there will find me till then i walk aloneahah ahah ahah aahah ahah ahahi walk alone i walk ai walk this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams where the city sleeps and im the only one and i walk amy shadows only one that walks beside me my shallow hearts the only thing thats beating sometimes i wish someone out there will find me till then i walk alone

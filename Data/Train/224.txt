 whats it all about alfie is it just for the moment we live whats it all about when you sort it out alfie are we meant to take more than we give or are we meant to be kind and if only fools are kind alfie then i guess it is wise to be cruel and if life belongs only to the strong alfie what will you lend on an old golden rule as sure as i believe theres a heaven above alfie i know theres something much more something even nonbelievers can believe in i believe in love alfie without true love we just exist alfie until you find the love youve missed youre nothing alfie when you walk let your heart lead the way and youll find love any day alfie alfie

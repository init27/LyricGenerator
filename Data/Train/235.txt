in penny lane there is a barber showing photographs of every head hes had the pleasure to know and all the people that come and go stop and say hello on the corner is a banker with a motorcar the little children laugh at him behind his back and the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain very strange penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes wet beneath the blue suburban skies i sit and meanwhile back in penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass and in his pocket is a portrait of the queen he likes to keep his fire engine clean its a clean machine penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes a four of fish and finger pies in summer meanwhile back behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout a pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray and though she feels as if shes in a play she is anyway penny lane the barber shaves another customer we see the banker sitting waiting for a trim and the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain very strange penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes there beneath the blue suburban skies i sit and meanwhile back penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes there beneath the blue suburban skies penny lane

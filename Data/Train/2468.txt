 ooh it must be magic how inside your eyes i see my destiny every time we kiss i feel you breathe your love so deep inside of meif the moon and stars should fall theyd be easy to replace i would lift you up to heaven and you would take their placeand i saw red when i opened up the door i saw red my heart just spilled onto the floor and i didnt need to see his face i saw yours i saw red and then i closed the door well i dont think im gonna love you anymoreevery day i wake up i thank god that you are still a part of me weve opened up the door to it so many people never find the keyand if the sun should ever fail to send its light we would burn a thousand candles and make everything alrightand i saw red when i opened up the door i saw red my heart just spilled onto the floor and i didnt need to see his face i saw yours i saw red and then i closed the door and i dont think im gonna love you anymoreand ive been hurt and ive been blind well im not sure that ill be fine i never thought it would end this waycause i saw red when i opened up the door i saw red my heart just spilled onto the floor and i didnt need to see his face oh i saw yours i saw red and then i closed the door i dont think im gonna love you anymoreooh it must be magic

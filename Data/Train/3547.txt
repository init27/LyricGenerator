 a hundred days have made me older since the last time that i saw your pretty face a thousand lies have made me colder and i dont think i can look at this the same all the miles that separate disappear now when im dreamin of your faceim here without you baby but youre still on my lonely mind i think about you baby and i dream about you all the time im here without you baby but youre still with me in my dreams and tonight girl its only you and methe miles just keep rollin as the people leave their way to say hello ive heard this life is overrated but i hope that it gets better as we goim here without you baby but youre still on my lonely mind i think about you baby and i dream about you all the time im here without you baby but youre still with me in my dreams and tonight its only you and meeverything i know and anywhere i go it gets hard but it wont take away my love and when the last one falls when its all said and done it gets hard but it wont take away my loveim here without you baby but youre still on my lonely mind i think about you baby and i dream about you all the time im here without you baby but youre still with me in my dreams and tonight its only you and me

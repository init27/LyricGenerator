 i was bruised and battered i couldnt tell what i felt i was unrecognizable to myself i saw my reflection in a window i didnt know my own face oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin away on the streets of philadelphiai walked the avenue til my legs felt like stone i heard the voices of friends vanished and gone at night i could hear the blood in my veins black and whispering as the rain on the streets of philadelphiaaint no angel gonna greet me its just you and i my friend my clothes dont fit me no more i walked a thousand miles just to slip this skinthe night has fallen im lyin awake i can feel myself fading away so receive me brother with your faithless kiss or will we leave each other alone like this on the streets of philadelphia

 strolling along country roads with my baby it starts to rain it begins to pour without an umbrella were soaked to the skin i feel a shiver run up my spinei feel the warmth of her hand in mineooh i hear laughter in the rain walking hand in hand with the one i love ooh how i love the rainy days and the happy way i feel insideafter a while we run under a tree i turn to her and she kisses me there with the beat of the rain on the leaves softly she breathes and i close my eyessharing our love under stormy skiesooh i hear laughter in the rain walking hand in hand with the one i love ooh how i love the rainy days and the happy way i feel insidei feel the warmth of her hand in mineooh i hear laughter in the rain walking hand in hand with the one i love ooh how i love the rainy days and the happy way i feel insideooh i hear laughter in the rain walking hand in hand with the one i love ooh how i love the rainy days and the happy way i feel inside

and i wake up in the mornin with my hair down in my eyes and she says hi and i stumble to the breakfast table while the kids are goin off to schoolgoodbye and she reaches out n takes my hand and squeezes it n says how ya feelin hon and i look across at smilin lips that warm my heart and see my mornin sun and if thats not lovin me then all ive got to say god didnt make little green apples and it dont rain in indianapolis in the summertime and theres no such thing as doctor seuss or disneyland and mother goose no nursery rhyme god didnt make little green apples and it dont rain in indianapolis in the summertime and when my self is feelin low i think about her face aglow and ease my mind sometimes i call her up at home knowin shes busy and ask her if she could get away and meet me and maybe we could grab a bite to eat and she drops what shes doin and she hurries down to meet me and im always late but she sits waitin patiently and smiles when she first sees me cause shes made that way and if that aint lovin me then all ive got to say god didnt make little green apples and it dont snow in minneapolis when the winter comes and theres no such thing as makebelieve puppy dogs autumn leaves n bb guns god didnt make little green apples and it dont rain in indianapolis

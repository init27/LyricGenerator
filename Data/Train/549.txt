each day through my window i watch her as she passes by i say to myself youre such a lucky guy to have a girl like her is truly a dream come true out of all the fellas in the world she belongs to me but it was just my imagination runnin away with me it was just my imagination runnin away with me soon soon well be married and raise a family a cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three i tell you i can visualize it all this couldnt be a dream for too real it all seems but it was just my imagination once again runnin away with me i tell you it was just my imagination runnin away with me every night on my knees i pray dear lord hear my plea dont ever let another take her love from me or i will surely die her love is heavenly when her arms enfold me i hear a tender rhapsody but in reality she doesnt even know me just my imagination once again runnin away with me i tell you it was just my imagination runnin away with me i never met her but i cant forget her just my imagination runnin away with me just my imagination runnin away with me

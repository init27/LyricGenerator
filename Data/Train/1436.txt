as the midnight moon was drifting through the lazy sway of the trees i saw the look in your eyes lookin into mine seeing what you wanted to see darlin dont say a word cause i already heard what your bodys sayin to mine im tired of fast moves ive got a slow groove on my mind i want a man with a slow hand i want a lover with an easy touch i want somebody who will spend some time not come and go in a heated rush i want somebody who will understand when it comes to love i want a slow hand on shadowed ground with no one around and a blanket of stars in our eyes we are drifting free like two lost leaves on the crazy wind of the night darlin dont say a word cause i already heard what your bodys sayin to mine if i want it all night you say its alright we got the time cause i got a man with a slow hand i got a lover with an easy touch i got somebody who will spend some time not come and go in a heated rush i found somebody who will understand when it comes to love i want a slow hand i want it all night please say its alright its not a fast move but a slow groove on my mind cause i got a man with a slow hand i got a lover with an easy touch i found somebody who will spend some time not come and go in a heated rush i found somebody who will understand i found a lover with a slow hand a lover with a slow hand and i get all excited with his easy touch i found somebody who will spend the night not come and go in a heated rush

all alone at the end of the evening and the bright lights have faded to blue i was thinking bout a woman who might have loved me and i never knew you know ive always been a dreamer spent my life running round and its so hard to change cant seem to settle down but the dreams ive seen lately keep on turning out and burning out and turning out the same so put me on a highway and show me a sign and take it to the limit one more time you can spend all your time making money you can spend all your love making time if it all fell to pieces tomorrow would you still be mine and when youre looking for your freedom nobody seems to care and you cant find the door cant find it anywhere when theres nothing to believe in still youre coming back youre running back youre coming back for more so put me on a highway and show me a sign and take it to the limit one more time take it to the limit take it to the limit take it to the limit one more time take it to the limit take it to the limit take it to the limit one more time take it to the limit take it to the limit take it to the limit one more time

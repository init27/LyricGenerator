 met my old lover in the grocery store the snow was falling christmas eve i stole behind her in the frozen foods and i touched her on the sleeveshe didnt recognize the face at first but then her eyes flew open wide she went to hug me and she spilled her purse and we laughed until we criedwe took her groceries to the checkout stand the food was totaled up and bagged we stood there lost in our embarrassment as the conversation draggedwe went to have ourselves a drink or two but couldnt find an open bar we bought a sixpack at the liquor store and we drank it in her carwe drank a toast to innocence we drank a toast to now and tried to reach beyond the emptiness but neither one knew howshe said shed married her an architect who kept her warm and safe and dry she would have liked to say she loved the man but she didnt like to liei said the years had been a friend to her and that her eyes were still as blue but in those eyes i wasnt sure if i saw doubt or gratitudeshe said she saw me in the record stores and that i must be doing well i said the audience was heavenly but the traveling was hellwe drank a toast to innocence we drank a toast to now and tried to reach beyond the emptiness but neither one knew howwe drank a toast to innocence we drank a toast to time reliving in our eloquence another auld lang synethe beer was empty and our tongues were tired and running out of things to say she gave a kiss to me as i got out and i watched her drive awayjust for a moment i was back at school and felt that old familiar pain and as i turned to make my way back home the snow turned into rain

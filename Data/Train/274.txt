 the old home town looks the same as i step down from the train and there to meet me is my mama and papadown the road i look and there runs mary hair of gold and lips like cherries its good to touch the green green grass of homeyes theyll all come to meet me arms reaching smiling sweetly its good to touch the green green grass of homethe old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry and theres that old oak tree that i used to play ondown the lane i walk with my sweet mary hair of gold and lips like cherries its good to touch the green green grass of homethen i awake and look around me at four gray walls that surround me and i realize yes i was only dreamingfor theres a guard and theres a sad old padre arm and arm well walk at daybreak again ill touch the green green grass of homeyes theyll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree as they lay me neath the green green grass of home

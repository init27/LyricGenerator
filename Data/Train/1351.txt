 lady mornings just a moment away and im without you once again you laughed at me you said youve never needed me i wonder if you need me now so many dreams that flew away so many words we didnt say two people lost in a storm where did we go whered we go we lost what we both had found you know we let each other down but then most of all i do love you stillwe played the games that people play we made our mistakes along the way somehow i know deep in my heart you needed me cause i needed you so desperately we were too blind to see but then most of all i do love you still

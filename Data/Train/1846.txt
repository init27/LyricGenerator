 out of the ruins out from the wreckage cant make the same mistake this time we are the children the last generation we are the ones they left behindand i wonder when we are ever gonna change it living under the fear till nothing else remainswe dont need another hero we dont need to know the way home all we want is life beyond the thunderdomelooking for something we can rely on theres got to be something better out there love and compassion their day is coming all else are castles built in the airand i wonder when we are ever gonna change it living under the fear till nothing else remainsall the children say we dont need another hero we dont need to know the way home all we want is life beyond the thunderdomeso what do we do with our lives we leave only a mark will our story shine like a life or end in the dark is it all or nothingwe dont need another hero hero we dont need to know the way home all we want is life beyond the thunderdomeall the children say we dont need another hero we dont need to know the way home all we want is life beyond the thunderdome

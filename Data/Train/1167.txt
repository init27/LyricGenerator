 dont know why im surviving every lonely day when theres got to be no chance for me my life would end and it doesnt matter how i cry my tears of love are a waste of time if i turn away am i strong enough to see it through go crazy is what i will do  if i cant have you i dont want nobody baby if i cant have you ah ah i cant have you i dont want nobody baby if i cant have you ah ahcant let go and it doesnt matter how i try i gave it all so easily to you my love to dreams that never will come true am i strong enough to see it through go crazy is what i will do repeat  till fade

once i thought that love was something i could never do never knew that i could feel this much but this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you is more than a reaction to your touch its a perfect passion and i cant get enough the way you look the way you laugh the way you love with all you have there aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me the way you kiss the way you cry the way you move when you walk by theres aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me in my life ive been hammered by some heavy blows that never knocked me off my feet all you gotta do is smile at me and down i go and baby its no mystery why i surrender girl you got everything the way you look the way you laugh the way you love with all you have there aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me the way you kiss the way you cry the way you move when you walk by theres aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me i love your attitude your rose tattoo your every thought your smile you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on the way you look the way you laugh the way you love with all you have there aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me the way you kiss the way you cry the way you move when you walk by theres aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me the way you look the way you laugh the way you love with all you have your dance your drive you make me feel alive the way you talk the way you tease by now i think you see there aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me

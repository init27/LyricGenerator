 spare a little candle save some light for me figures up ahead moving in the trees white skin in linen perfume on my wrist and the full moon that hangs over these dreams in the mistdarkness on the edge shadows where i stand i search for the time on a watch with no hands i want to see you clearly come closer than this but all i remember are the dreams in the mistthese dreams go on when i close my eyes every second of the night i live another life these dreams that sleep when its cold outside every moment im awake the further im awayis it cloak n dagger could it be spring or fall i walk without a cut through a stained glass wall weaker in my eyesight the candle in my grip and words that have no form are falling from my lipsthese dreams go on when i close my eyes every second of the night i live another life these dreams that sleep when its cold outside every moment im awake the further im awaytheres something out there i cant resist i need to hide away from the pain theres something out there i cant resistthe sweetest song is silence that ive ever heard funny how your feet in dreams never touch the earth in a wood full of princes freedom is a kiss but the prince hides his face from dreams in the mistthese dreams go on when i close my eyes every second of the night i live another life these dreams that sleep when its cold outside every moment im awake the further im awaythese dreams go on when i close my eyes every second of the night i live another life these dreams that sleep when its cold outside every moment im awake the further im away

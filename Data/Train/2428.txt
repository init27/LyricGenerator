 people are talkin bout people i hear them whisper you wont believe it they think were lovers kept under covers i just ignore it but they keep saying we laugh just a little too loud we stand just a little too close we stare just a little too long maybe theyre seeing something we dont darlinlets give them something to talk about lets give them something to talk about lets give them something to talk about how about lovei feel so foolish i never noticed youd act so nervous could you be falling for me it took a rumor to make me wonder now im convinced im going under thinking bout you every day dreaming bout you every night hoping that you feel the same way now that we know it lets really show it darlinlets give them something to talk about lets give them something to talk about lets give them something to talk about how about love love love love

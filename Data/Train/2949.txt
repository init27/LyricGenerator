 im packed and im holding im smiling shes living shes golden and she lives for me she says she lives for me ovation shes got her own motivation she comes round and she goes down on me and i make her smile its like a drug for you do ever what you want to do coming over you keep on smiling what we go through one stop to the rhythm that divides you and i speak to you like the chorus to the verse chop another line like a coda with a curse and i come on like a freak show takes the stage we give them the games we play she said i want something else to get me through this semicharmed kind of life baby baby i want something else im not listening when you say goodbye the sky it was gold it was rose i was taking sips of it through my nose and i wish i could get back there some place back there smiling in the pictures you would take doing crystal myth will lift you up until you break it wont stop i wont come down i keep stock with a ticktock rhythm and a bump for the drop and then i bumped up i took the hit i was given then i bumped again and then i bumped again how do i get back there to the place where i fell asleep inside you how do i get myself back to the place where you said i want something else to get me through this semicharmed kind of life baby baby i want something else im not listening when you say goodbye i believe in the sand beneath my toes the beach gives a feeling an earthy feeling i believe in the faith that grows and the four right chords can make me cry when im with you i feel like i could die and that would be all right all right when the plane came in she said she was crashing the velvet it rips in the city we tripped on the urge to feel alive but now im struggling to survive the days you were wearing that velvet dress youre the priestess i must confess those little red panties they pass the test slide up around the belly face down on the mattress one now you hold me and were broken still its all that i want to do just a little i feel myself with a head made of the ground im scared but im not coming down and i wont run for my life shes got her jaws just locked now in smile but nothing is all right all right i want something else to get me through this life i want something else im not listening when you say goodbye

 i know theres something in the wake of your smile i get a notion from the look in your eyes yea youve built a love but that love falls apart your little piece of heaven turns to darklisten to your heart when hes calling for you listen to your heart theres nothing else you can doi dont know where youre going and i dont know why but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbyesometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile the precious moments are all lost in the tide yea theyre swept away and nothing is what is seems the feeling of belonging to your dreamslisten to your heart when hes calling for you listen to your heart theres nothing else you can doi dont know where youre going and i dont know why but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbyeand there are voices that want to be heard so much to mention but you cant find the words the scent of magic the beauty thats been when love was wilder then the windlisten to your heart when hes calling for you listen to your heart theres nothing else you can doi dont know where youre going and i dont know why but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye listen to your heart oohi dont know where youre going and i dont know why but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

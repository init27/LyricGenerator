 my lips are shaking my nails are bit off been a month since ive heard myself talk all the advantage this lifes got on me picture a coffin in the middle of the seaand i fight back in my mind never lets me be right i got memories i got shit so much it dont showoh i walked the line when you held me in that night i walked the line when you held my hand that nightan empty shell seems so easy to crack got all these questions dont know who i could even ask so ill just lie alone and wait for the dream where im not ugly and youre looking at meand i stay in bed oh little ive seen there if just once i could feel love oh stare back at me  yeahbut i walked the line when you held me in that night oh i walked the line when you held my hand that night oh i walked the line when you held me close that night i paid the price never held you in real life my lips are shaking

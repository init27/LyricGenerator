 once i believed that when love came to me it would come with rockets bells and poetry but with me and you it just started quietly and grew and believe it or not now theres something groovy and good bout whatever we gotand its getting better growing stronger warm and wilder getting better everyday better everyday i dont feel all turned on and starry eyed i just feel a sweet contentment deep inside holding you at night just seems kind of natural and rightand its not hard to see that it isnt half of what its going to turn out to be cause its getting better growing stronger warm and wilder getting better everyday better everyday ba da da da da da da da da da da daand i dont mind waitin dont mind waitin cause no matter how long it takes the two of us know that its getting better growing stronger warm and wilder getting better everyday better everyday

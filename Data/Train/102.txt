 as i walk this land with broken dreams i have visions of many things loves happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion what becomes of the broken hearted who had love thats now departed i know ive got to find some kind of peace of mind maybe the fruits of love grow all around but for me they come a tumblin down every day heartaches grow a little stronger i cant stand this pain much longer i walk in shadows searching for light cold and alone no comfort in sight hoping and praying for someone to care always moving and goin to where what becomes of the broken hearted who had love thats now departed i know ive got to find some kind of peace of mind maybe im searching though i dont succeed but someone look theres a growing need oh he is lost theres no place for beginning all thats left is an unhappy ending now whats become of the brokenhearted who had love thats now departed i know ive got to find some kind of peace of mind ill be searching everywhere just to find someone to care ill be looking everyday i know im gonna find a way nothings gonna stop me now ill find a way somehow ill be searching everywhere

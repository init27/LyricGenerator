people say im the life of the party cause i tell a joke or two although i might be laughing loud and hearty deep inside im blue so take a good look at my face you know my smile looks out of place if you look closer its easy to trace the tracks of my tears i need you need you since you left me if you see me with another girl looking like im having fun although she may be cute shes just a substitute cause youre the permanent one so take a good look at my face you know my smile looks out of place if you look closer its easy to trace the tracks of my tears outside im masquerading inside my hope is fading im just a clown since you put me down my smile is my make up i wear since my breakup with you baby take a good look at my face you know my smile looks out of place if you look closer its easy to trace the tracks of my tears

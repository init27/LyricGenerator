 i awakened this morning i was filled with despair all my dreams turned to ashes now they are gone as i looked at my life it was barren and so bare without love ive had nothing nothing at allwithout love ive had nothing without love i had nothing nothing at all i have conquered the world but one thing did i have without love i had nothing nothing at alli once had a sweetheart who loved only me there was nothing that she would not give no no i was blind to her goodness and i just could not see that a heart without love cannot livewithout love ive had nothing without love i had nothing nothing at all i have conquered the world but one thing did i have without love i had nothing nothing at all without love i had nothing nothing at all

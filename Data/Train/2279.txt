oconnor sinead i still do not want what i havent got nothing compares 2 u its been seven hours and fifteen days since u took your love away i go out every night and sleep all day since u took your love away since u been gone i can do whatever i want i can see whomever i choose i can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant but nothing i said nothing can take away these blues cos nothing compares nothing compares 2 u its been so lonely without u here like a bird without a song nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling tell me baby were did i go wrong i could put my arms around every boy i see but theyd only remind me of you i went to the doctor guess what he told me guess what he told me he said girl u better have fun no matter what u do but hes a fool cos nothing compares nothing compares 2 u all the flowers that u planted mama in the back yard all died when u went away i know that living with u baby was sometimes hard but im willing to give it another try cos nothing compares nothing compares 2 u

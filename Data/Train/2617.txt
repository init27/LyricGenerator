 my shattered dreams and broken heart are mending on the shelf i saw you holding hands standing close to someone else now i sit all alone wishing all my feeling was gonei gave my best to you nothing for me to do but have one last cryone last cry before i leave it all behind ive gotta put you outta my mind this time stop living a lie i guess im down to my last cry cryi was here you were there guess we never could agree while the sun shines on you i need some love to rain on me still i sit all alone wishing all my feeling was gonegotta get over you nothing for me to do but have one last cryone last cry before i leave it all behind ive gotta put you outta my mind this time stop living a lie i know ive gotta be strong cause round me life goes on and on and on and onim gonna dry my eyes right after i had my one last cryone last cry before i leave it all behind ive gotta put you outta my mind for the very last time been living a lie i guess im down i guess im down i guess im down to my last cry

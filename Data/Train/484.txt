hoverin by my suitcase tryin to find a warm place to spend the night heavy rain fallin seems i hear your voice callin its all right a rainy night in georgia a rainy night in georgia it seems like its rainin all over the world i feel like its rainin all over the world neon signs aflashin taxi cabs and buses passin through the night a distant moanin of a train seems to play a sad refrain to the night a rainy night in georgia such a rainy night in georgia lord i believe its rainin all over the world i feel like its rainin all over the world how many times i wondered it still comes out the same no matter how you look at it or think of it its life and you just got to play the game i find me a place in a box car so i take my guitar to pass some time late at night when its hard to rest i hold your picture to my chest and i feel fine but its a rainy night in georgia baby its a rainy night in georgia i feel its rainin all over the world kinda lonely now and its rainin all over the world oh have you ever been lonely people and you feel that it was rainin all over this mans world youre talking bout rainin rainin rainin rainin rainin rainin rainin rainin rainin rainin rainin rainin rainin rainin over the world i said now rainin rainin rainin

 whenever i chance to meet some old friends on the street they wonder how does a man get to be this way ive always got a smilin face any time and any place and everytime they ask me why i just smile and say youve got to kiss an angel good mornin and let her know you think about her when youre gone kiss an angel good mornin and love her like a devil when you get back homewell people may try to guess the secret of happiness but some of them never learn its a simple thing the secret im speaking of is a woman and a man in love and the answer is in the song that i always sing youve got to kiss an angel good mornin kiss an angel good mornin

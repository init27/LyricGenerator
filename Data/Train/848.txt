 you and me against the world sometimes it feels like you and me against the world when all the others turn their backs and walk away you can count on me to stayremember when the circus came to town and you were frightened by the clown wasnt it nice to be around someone that you knew someone who was big and strong and looking out foryou and me against the world sometimes it feels like you and me against the world and for all the times weve cried i always felt that god was on our sideand when one of us is gone and one of us is left to carry on then remembering will have to do our memories alone will get us through think about the days of me and you you and me against the world

 you left me here on your way to paradise you pulled the rug right out from under my life i know where you goin to i knew when you came home last night cause your eyes had a mist from the smoke of a distant firelord i was stunned shoulda seen it come a long time ago when i realized the reality gave me a roll if things are the same then explain why your kiss is so cold and that mist in your eyes feels like rain on the fire in my soulthis lying and cryin its upsettin and gettin ya no where it dont stack up so slack up and pack up i just dont care dont let the screen door hit you on your way out dont you drown when your dream boat runs onto the groundbreakid just like to know do you love him or just making time by filling his glass with your fast flowing bittersweet lime hell taste the aftertaste when you come home late some night with your eyes all a mist from the smoke of a distant firegirl your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire girl your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire girl your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire girl your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire girl your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire mist in your eyes from a distant fire girl your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a dis a distant fire

 i didnt know what day it was when you walked into the room i said hello unnoticed you said goodbye too soonbreezing through the clientele spinning yarns that were so lyrical i really must confess right here the attraction was purely physicali took all those habits of yours that in the beginning were hard to accept your fashion sense beardsly prints i put down to experiencethe big bosomed lady with the dutch accent who tried to change my point of view her ad lib lines were well rehearsed but my heart cried out for youchorus youre in my heart youre in my soul youll be my breath should i grow old you are my lover youre my best friend youre in my soulmy love for you is immeasurable my respect for you immense youre ageless timeless lace and fineness youre beauty and eleganceyoure a rhapsody a comedy youre a symphony and a play youre every love song ever written but honey what do you see in mechorusyoure an essay in glamour please pardon the grammar but youre every schoolboys dream youre celtic united but baby ive decided youre the best team ive ever seenand there have been many affairs many times ive thought to leave but i bite my lip and turn around cause youre the warmest thing ive ever foundchorus

im sittin in the railway station got a ticket for my destination on a tour of one night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand and every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one man band homeward bound i wish i was homeward bound home where my thoughts escapin home where my musics playin home where my love lies waitin silently for me everydays an endless stream of cigarettes and magazines and each town looks the same to me the movies and the factories and every strangers face i see reminds me that i long to be homeward bound i wish i was homeward bound home where my thoughts escapin home where my musics playin home where my love lies waitin silently for me tonight ill sing my songs again ill play the game and pretend but all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity like emptiness in harmony i need someone to comfort me homeward bound i wish i was homeward bound home where my thoughts escapin home where my musics playin home where my love lies waitin silently for me silently for me

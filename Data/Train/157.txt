 last night all alone in a barroom met a girl with a drink in her hand she had ruby red lips coal black hair and eyes that would tempt any manthen she came and sat down at my table and as she placed her soft hands in mine i found myself wanting to kiss her for temptation was flowing like wineand i was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride almost persuaded to push my conscience asidethen we danced and she whispered i need you take me away from here and be my man then ive looked into her eyes and i saw it the reflection of my wedding band

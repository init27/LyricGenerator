shadows grow so long before my eyes and theyre moving across the page suddenly the day turns into night far away from the city but dont hesitate cuz your love wont wait ooh baby i love your way everyday i wanna tell you i love your way every way i wanna be with you night and day ooh yeah moon appears to shine and light the sky with the help of some big glitters wonder how they have the power to shine shine shine i can see them under the pine but dont hesitate cuz your love wont wait ooh baby i love your way everyday i wanna tell you i love your way every way i wanna be with you night and day but dont hesitate cuz your love wont wait i can see the sunset in your eyes brown and gray and blue besides clouds are stalking islands in the sun wish i could buy one out of season but dont hesitate cuz your love wont wait ooh baby i love your way everyday i wanna tell you i love your way i wanna be with you night and day ooh baby i love your way i wanna tell you i love your way i wanna be with you night and day yeah

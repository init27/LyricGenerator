 look at the sky tell me what do you see just close your eyes and describe it to me the heavens are sparkling with starlight tonight thats what i see through your eyesi see the heavens each time that you smile i hear your heartbeat just go on for miles and suddenly i know my life is worth while thats what i see through your eyeshere in the night i see the sun here in the dark our two hearts are one its out of our hands we cant stop what we have begun and love just took me by surprise looking through your eyesi look at myself and instead i see us whoever i am now it feels like enough and i see a girl who is learning to trust thats who i see through your eyeshere in the night i see the sun here in the dark our two hearts are one its out of our hands we cant stop what we have begun and love just took me by surprise looking through your eyesand there are some things we dont know sometimes a heart just needs to go and there is so much that ill remember underneath the open sky with you foreverhere in the night i see the sun here in the dark our two hearts are one its out of our hands we cant stop what we have begun and love just took me by surprise looking through your eyes looking through your eyes

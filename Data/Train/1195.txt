 shalalalalala my lady in the sun with your hair undone can you hear me now calling your name from across the bay a summers day laughing and ahidin chasing love out on thunder islandshe was the color of the indian summer and we shared the hours without number until one day when the sky turned dark and the winds grew wild caught by the rain and blinded by the lightnin we rode the storm out there on thunder islandi held her close until the storm passed and we fell down laughing in the wet grass both our bodies drying in the sunshine sweet sunshine so shalalalalala my lady in the sun with your dress undone now evry mile away and evry day cuts a little deeper ill remember the nights in the cool sand making love out on thunder island

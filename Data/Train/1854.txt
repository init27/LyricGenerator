 all through the night ill be awake and ill be with you all through the night this precious time when time is new oh all through the night today knowing that we feel the same without sayingwe have no past we wont reach back keep with me forward all through the night and once we start the meter clicks and it goes running all through the night until it ends there is no endall through the night stray cat is crying so stray cat sings back all through the night they have forgotten what by day they lack oh under those white street lamps there is a little chance they may seewe have no past we wont reach back keep with me forward all through the night and once we start the meter clicks and it goes running all through the night until it ends there is no endoh the sleep in your eyes is enough let me be there let me stay there awhilewe have no past we wont reach back keep with me forward all through the night and once we start the meter clicks and it goes running all through the night until it ends there is no end keep with me forward all through the night and once we start the meter clicks and it goes running all through the night until it ends there is no end

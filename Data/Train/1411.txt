 whenever dark has fallen you know the spirit of the party starts to come alive until the day is dawning you can throw out all the blues and hit the city lightscause theres music in the air and lots of lovin everywhere so give me the night give me the nightyou need the evening action a place to dine a glass of wine a little late romance its a chain reaction well see the people of the world coming out to dancecause theres music in the air and lots of lovin everywhere so give me the night give me the nightso come on out tonight and well lead the others on a ride through paradise and if you feel all right then we can be lovers cause i see that starlight look in your eyes well dont you know we can flyjust give me the night give me the nightcause theres music in the air and lots of lovin everywhere so give me the night give me the nightso come on out tonight and well lead the others on a ride through paradise and if you feel all right then we can be lovers cause i see that starlight look in your eyes dont you know we can flyand if we stay together well feel the rhythm of the evening taking us up high never mind the weather well be dancing in the street until the morning lightcause theres music in the air and lots of lovin everywhere so give me the night give me the night give me the night give me the night

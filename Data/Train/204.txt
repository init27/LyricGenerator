she would never say where she came from yesterday dont matter when its gone while the sun is bright or in the darkest night no one knows she comes and goes goodbye ruby tuesday who could hang a name on you when you smile with every new day still im gonna miss you dont question why she needs to be so free shell tell you its the only way to be she just cant be chained to a life where nothings gained and nothings lost at such a cost theres no time to lose i heard her say catch your dreams before they slip away dying all the time lose your dreams and you will lose your mind aint life unkind goodbye ruby tuesday who could hang a name on you when you smile with every new day still im gonna miss you

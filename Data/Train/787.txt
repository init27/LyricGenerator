he remembers the first time he met her he remembers the first thing she said he remembers the first time he held her and the night that she came to his bed he remembers her sweet way of singin honey has somethin gone wrong he remembers the fun and the teasin and the reason he wrote her this song ill give you a daisy a day ill give you a daisy a day ill love you until the rivers run still and the four winds we know blow away they would walk down the street in the evenin and for years i would see them go by and their love that was more than the clothes that they wore could be seen in the gleam of their eye as a kid they would take me for candy and i loved to go taggin along wed hold hands while we walked to the corner and the old man would sing her his song ill give you a daisy a day ill give you a daisy a day ill love you until the rivers run still and the four winds we know blow away now he walks down the street in the evenin and he stops by the old candy store and i somehow believe hes believin hes holdin her hand like before for he feels all her love walkin with him and he smiles at the things she might say then the old man walks up to the hilltop and gives her a daisy a day ill give you a daisy a day ill give you a daisy a day ill love you until the rivers run still and the four winds we know blow away

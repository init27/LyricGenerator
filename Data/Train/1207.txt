 friday night it was late i was walking you home we got down to the gate i was dreaming of the night would it turn out right how to tell you girl i want to build my world around you wanna tell you that its true i wanna make you understand im talking about a lifetime planwell thats the way it began we were handinhand glen millers band was better than before we yelled and screamed for more and those porters tunes made us dance across the room it ended all too soon on the way back home i promised youd never be alonehurry dont be late i cant hardly wait i said to myself when were old well go dancing in the dark walking through the park and reminiscingfriday night it was late i was walking you home we got down to the gate i was dreaming of the night would it turn out right now as the years roll on each time we hear our favourite song the memories come along older times were missing spending the hours reminiscing

 empty spaces fill me up with holes distant faces with no place left to go without you within me i can find no rest where im goin is anybodys guessi tried to go on like i never knew you im awake but my world is half asleep i pray for this heart to be unbroken but without you all im going to be is incompletevoices tell me i should carry on but i am swimming in an ocean all alone baby my baby its written on your face you still wonder if we made a big mistakei tried to go on like i never knew you im awake but my world is half asleep i pray for this heart to be unbroken but without you all im going to be is incompletei dont mean to drag it on but i cant seem to let you go i dont wanna make you face this world alone i want to let you go alonei tried to go on like i never knew you im awake but my world is half asleep i pray for this heart to be unbroken but without you all im going to be is incomplete incomplete

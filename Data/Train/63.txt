sick at heart and lonely deep in dark despair thinking one thought only where is she tell me where and if she says to you she dont love me just give her my message tell her of my plea and i know well if she had me back again well i would never make her sad ive gotta heart full of soul and i know well if she had me back again well i would never make her sad ive gotta heart full of soul shes been gone such a long time longer than i can bear but if she says she wants me tell her that ill be there and if she says to you she dont love me just give her my message tell her of my plea and i know well if she had me back again well i would never make her sad ive gotta heart full of soul

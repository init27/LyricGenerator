 so soon just after youve gone my senses sharpen but it always takes so damn long before i feel how much my eyes have darkenedfear hangs in a plane of gun smoke drifting in our room so easy to disturb with a thought with a whisper with a careless memory with a careless memoryon the table signs of love lies scattered and the walls break with a crashing within its not as though as though you really mattered but being close how could i let you go without some feeling some precious sympathy followingfear hangs in a plane of gun smoke drifting in our room so easy to disturb with a thought with a whisper with a careless memory with a careless memory with a careless memory with a careless memoryi walk out into the sun i try to find a new day but the whole place just screams in my eyes where are you now cause i dont want to meet you i think id die i think id laugh at you i know id cry what am i supposed to do follow yououtside the thoughts coming flooding back now i just try to forget youso easy to disturb with a thought with a whisper with a careless memory with a careless memory with a careless memory look out with a careless memory with a careless memory look out look out look out look out

i dont know when to start or when to stop my lucks like a button i cant stop pushing it my head feels light but im still in the dark seems like without tenderness theres something missing tenderness where is the tenderness where is it i dont know where i am but i know i dont like it i open my mouth and out pops something spiteful words are so cheap but they can turn out expensive words like conviction can turn into a sentence i held your hands rings but none on that finger we danced and danced but i was scared to go much further with it just half a chance make sure that one night youre here but next night youre not it always leaves me searching for a little tenderness where is the tenderness where is the tenderness whistling in the graveyard calling up your girlfriend just trying to make her understand youre squeezing the telephone like it was her hand no question so many questions shes going to catch you out boy it all seems so underhand now shes the only thing that ever made you feel like a man man madman madman tenderness where is the tenderness tenderness tenderness where is it i held your hands rings but none on that finger we danced and danced but i was scared to go much further with it just half a chance make sure that one night youre here but next night youre not it always leaves me searching for a little tenderness where is the tenderness when youre sick to death of second best pet why should the morning always find you unimpressed is your love like a button you cant stop pushing it oh this all night longing can be such a long time

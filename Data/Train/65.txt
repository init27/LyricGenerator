last night at the dance i met laurie so lovely and warm an angel of a girl last night i fell in love with laurie strange things happen in this world as i walked her home she said it was her birthday i pulled her close and said will i see you anymore then suddenly she asked for my sweater and said that she was very very cold i kissed her goodnight at her door and started home then thought about my sweater and went right back instead i knocked at her door and a man appeared i told why id come then he said youre wrong son you werent with my daughter how can you be so cruel to come to me this way my laurie left this world on her birthday she died a year ago today a strange force drew me to the graveyard i stood in the dark i saw the shadows wave and then i looked and saw my sweater lyin there upon her grave strange things happen in this world

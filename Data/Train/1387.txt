 shes out of my life shes out of my life and i dont know whether to laugh or cry i dont know whether to live or die and it cuts like a knife shes out of my lifeits out of my hands its out of my hands to think for two years she was here and i took her for granted i was so cavalier now the way that it stands shes out of my handsso ive learned that loves not possession and ive learned that love wont wait now ive learned that love needs expression but i learned too lateshes out of my life shes out of my life damned indecision and cursed pride kept my love for her locked deep inside and it cuts like a knife shes out of my life

 didnt i hear you cry this mornin didnt i feel you weep teardrops flowin down on me like rivers in my sleepin my dream of laughter you came creeping with your fears telling me your sorrow in the trace ends of your tearsthats a strange way to tell me you love me when your sorrow is all i can see if you just want to cry to somebody dont cry to me no dont cry to me nodidnt i hear your voice this mornin didnt you call my name i heard you whisper softly but the words were never plainand in your dream of darkness i came shinin like a sun waiting for the laughter but the laughter never caughtthats a strange way to tell me you love me when your sorrow is all i can see if you just want to cry to somebody dont cry to me no dont cry to me nodidnt you feel alone this mornin didnt you need a friend and in your darkest hour you came runnin back againthats a strange way to tell me you love me thats a strange way to tell me you love me thats a strange way to tell me you love me

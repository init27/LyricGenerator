 just when i believed i couldnt ever want for more this ever changing world pushes me through another door i saw you smile and my mind could not erase the beauty of your face just for awhile wont you let me shelter youhold on to the nights hold on to the memories i wish that i could give you something more that i could be yourshow do we explain something that took us by surprise promises in vain love that is real but in disguise what happens now do we break another rule let our lovers play the fool i dont know how to stop feeling this wayhold on to the nights hold on to the memories i wish that i could give you something more that i could be yourswell i think that ive been true to everybody else but me and the way i feel about you makes my heart long to be free every time i look into your eyes im helplessly aware that the someone ive been searching for is right therehold on to the nights hold on to the memories i wish that i could give you more hold on to the nights

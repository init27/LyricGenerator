i feel tears well in up from deep inside like my hearts goin to break and a stab of loneliness sharp and painful that i may never shake you might say that i was takin it hard since you gave me the final goodbye but dont you wager that ill hide the sorrow when i may break right down and cry now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch heartaches are goin to the inside my tears are holdin back theyre tryin not to fall my hearts out of the runnin true loves scratched for anothers sake the race is on and it looks like heartaches and the winner loses all one day i ventured in love never once suspectin what the final results would be how i lived in fear of wakin up each mornin and find that youre gone from me theres ache and pain in my heart for the name of the one that ill never replaced somebody new came up to win her and i came out in second place now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch heartaches are goin to the inside my tears are holdin back theyre tryin not to fall my hearts out of the runnin true loves scratched for anothers sake the race is on and it looks like heartaches and the winner loses all

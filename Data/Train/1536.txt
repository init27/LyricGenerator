 we walked the loneliest mile we smile without any style we kiss all together wrong no intentionwe lie about each others drinks we live without each other thinking what anyone would do without me and youits like i told you only the lonely can playso hold on here we go hold on to nothin we know i feel so lonely way up hereyou mention the time we were together so long ago well i dont remember all i know is it makes me feel good nowits like i told you only the lonely can play only the lonely only the lonely can playonly the lonely only the lonely can play its like i told you only the lonely can play only the lonely only the lonely can play

 the wind is moving but i am standing still a life of pages waiting to be filled a heart thats hopeful a head thats full of dreams but this becoming is harder than it seems feels like imlooking for a reason roaming through the night to find my place in this world my place in this world not a lot to lean on i need your light to help me find my place in this world my place in this worldif there are millions down on their knees among the many can you still hear me hear me asking where do i belong is there a vision that i can call my own show me imlooking for a reason roaming through the night to find my place in this world my place in this world not a lot to lean on i need your light to help me find my place in this world my place in this worldlooking for a reason roaming through the night to find my place in this world my place in this world not a lot to lean on i need your light to help me find my place in this world my place in this worldlooking for a reason roaming through the night to find my place in this world my place in this world

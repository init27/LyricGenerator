hootie and the blowfish cracked rear view let her cry she sits alone by a lamppost trying to find a thought thats escaped her mind she says dads the one i love the most but stipes not far behind she never lets me in only tells me where shes been when shes had too much to drink i say that i dont care i just run my hands through her dark hair then i pray to god you gotta help me fly away and just let her cry if the tears fall down like rain let her sing if it eases all her pain let her go let her walk right out on me and if the sun comes up tomorrow let her be let her be this morning i woke up alone found a note standing by the phone saying baby maybe ill be back someday i wanted to look for you you walked in i didnt know just what i should do so i sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself saying let her cry if the tears fall down like rain let her sing if it eases all her pain let her go let her walk right out on me and if the sun comes up tomorrow let her be let her be let her cry if the tears fall down like rain let her sing if it eases all her pain let her go let her walk right out on me and if the sun comes up tomorrow let her be oh last night i tried to leave cried so much i could not believe she was the same girl i fell in love with long ago she went in the back to get high i sat down on my couch and cried yellin oh momma please help me wont you hold my hand and let her cry if the tears fall down like rain let her sing if it eases all her pain let her go let her walk right out on me and if the sun comes up tomorrow let her be let her cry if the tears fall down like rain let her sing if it eases all her pain let her go let her walk right out on me and if the sun comes up tomorrow let her be oh let her be

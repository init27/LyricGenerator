hootie and the blowfish cracked rear view time time why you punish me like a wave bashing into the shore you wash away my dreams time why you walk away like a friend with somewhere to go you left me crying can you teach me about tommorrow and all the pain and sorrow running free cause tomorrows just another day and i dont believe in time time i dont understand children killing in the street dying for the color of red time hey there red and blue wash them in the ocean make them clean maybe their mothers wont cry tonight can you teach me about tomorrow all the pain and sorrow running free but tomorrows just another day and i dont believe in chorus time is wasting time is walking you aint no friend of mine i dont know where im goin i think im out of my mind thinking about time and if i die tomorrow yeah just lay me down in sleep chorus time you left me standing there like a tree growing all alone the wind just stripped me bare stripped me bare time the past has come and gone the futures far away now only lasts for one second one second can you teach me about tomorrow and all the pain and sorrow running free cause tomorrows just another day and i dont believe in time chorus time why you punish me

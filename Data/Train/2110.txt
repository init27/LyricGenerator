 there was a time when broken hearts and broken dreams were over there was a place where all you could do was wish on a four leaf clover but now is a new time there is a new place where dreams just cant come true it started the day when i left you ohi could never love again the way i loved you oh i could never cry again like i did when i left you and when we said goodbye oh the look in your eyes just left me beside myself without your heart without your heart i could never love again now that were apartoh when i was sorry it was too late to turn around turn around and tell you so there was no reason there was no reason just a foolish beat of my hearti could never love again the way i loved you i could never cry again like i did when i left you and when we said goodbye oh the look in your eyes just left me beside myself without your heart without your heart i could never love again now that were apartoh cant you see im not fooling nobody dont you see the tears are falling down my face since you went away break my heart you slipped away didnt know i was wrong never meant to hurt you now youre gonei could never love again now that were apart now that were apart i could never love again now that were apart

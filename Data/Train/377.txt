 what is a youth impetuous fire what is a maid ice and desire the world wags on a rose will bloom it then will fade so does a youth so does a fairest maid comes a time when one sweet smile has its season for awhile then loves in love with me some may think only to marry other will tease and tarry mine is the very best parry cupid he rules us all caper the caper sing me the song death will come soon to hush us along sweeter than honey as bitter as gall love is the pasttime that will never pall sweeter than honey as bitter as gall cupid he rules us all repeat a rose will bloom it then will fade so does a youth so does the fairest maid

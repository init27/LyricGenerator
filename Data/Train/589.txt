 into my room he creeps without making a sound into my dreams he peeps with his hair all long and hanging downhow he makes me quiver how he makes me smile with all this love i have to give you i guess im gonna stay with him awhileshe brushes the curls from my eyes she drops her robe on the floor and she reaches for the light on the bureau and the darkness is her pillow once morehow she makes me quiver how she makes me smile with all this love i have to give her i guess im gonna stay with her awhilehow it makes me quiver how it makes me smile with all this love i have to give you guess im gonna stay with you awhilehow it makes me quiver how it makes me smile with all this love i have to give you guess im gonna stay with you awhilestay with you awhile i guess im gonna stay

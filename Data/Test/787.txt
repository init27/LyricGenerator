 when the days are cold and the cards all fold and the saints we see are all made of goldwhen your dreams all fail and the ones we hail are the worst of all and the bloods run stalei wanna hide the truth i wanna shelter you but with the beast inside theres nowhere we can hideno matter what we breed we still are made of greed this is my kingdom come this is my kingdom comewhen you feel my heat look into my eyes its where my demons hide its where my demons hidedont get too close its dark inside its where my demons hide its where my demons hideat the curtains call its the last of all when the lights fade out all the sinners crawlso they dug your grave and the masquerade will come calling out at the mess youve madedont wanna let you down but i am hell bound though this is all for you dont wanna hide the truthno matter what we breed we still are made of greed this is my kingdom come this is my kingdom comewhen you feel my heat look into my eyes its where my demons hide its where my demons hidedont get too close its dark inside its where my demons hide its where my demons hidethey say its what you make i say its up to fate its woven in my soul i need to let you goyour eyes they shine so bright i wanna save that light i cant escape this now unless you show me howwhen you feel my heat look into my eyes its where my demons hide its where my demons hidedont get too close its dark inside its where my demons hide its where my demons hide

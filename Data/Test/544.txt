 im so glad you made time to see me hows life tell me hows your family i havent seen them in a while youve been good busier then ever we small talk work and the weather your guard is up and i know whybecause the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind you gave me roses and i left them there to dieso this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying im sorry for that night and i go back to december all the time it turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you wishing id realized what i had when you were mine id go back to december turn around and make it all right i go back to december all the timethese days i havent been sleeping staying up playing back myself leaving when your birthday passed and i didnt call and i think about summer all the beautiful times i watched you laughing from the passenger side and realized id loved you in the fall and then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbyeso this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying im sorry for that night and i go back to december all the time it turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you wishing id realized what i had when you were mine id go back to december turn around and change my own mind i go back to december all the timei miss your tan skin your sweet smile so good to me so right and how you held me in your arms that september night the first time you ever saw me cry maybe this is wishful thinking probably mindless dreaming but if we loved again i swear id love you rightid go back in time and change it but i cant so if the chain is on your door i understandbut this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying im sorry for that night and i go back to december it turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you wishing id realized what i had when you were mine id go back to december turn around and make it all right id go back to december turn around and change my own mind i go back to december all the time all the time

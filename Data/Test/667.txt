 the cycle repeated as explosions broke in the sky all that i needed was the one thing i couldnt find and you were there at the turn waiting to let me knowwere building it up to break it back down were building it up to burn it down we cant wait to burn it to the groundthe colors conflicted as the flames climbed into the clouds i wanted to fix this but couldnt stop from tearing it down and you were there at the turn caught in the burning glow and i was there at the turn waiting to let you knowwere building it up to break it back down were building it up to burn it down we cant wait to burn it to the groundyou told me yes you held me high and i believed when you told that lie i played soldier you played king and struck me down when i kissed that ring you lost that right to hold that crown i built you up but you let me down so when you fall ill take my turn and fan the flames as your blazes burnand you were there at the turn waiting to let me knowwere building it up to break it back down were building it up to burn it down we cant wait to burn it to the groundwhen you fall ill take my turn and fan the flames as your blazes burnwe cant wait to burn it to the groundwhen you fall ill take my turn and fan the flames as your blazes burnwe cant wait to burn it to the ground

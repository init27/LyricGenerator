 the snow glows white on the mountain tonight not a footprint to be seen a kingdom of isolation and it looks like im the queen the wind is howling like this swirling storm inside couldnt keep it in heaven knows ive trieddont let them in dont let them see be the good girl you always have to be conceal dont feel dont let them know well now they knowlet it go let it go cant hold it back anymore  meaning  bylisanc     this is such a very powerful song especially when i begin to really discover what is the it that i have to let go let it go your true self let your    see all   let it go let it go turn away and slam the door i dont care what theyre going to say let the storm rage on the cold never bothered me anywayits funny how some distance makes everything seem small and the fears that once controlled me cant get to me at allits time to see what i can do to test the limits and break through no right no wrong no rules for me im freelet it go let it go i am one with the wind and sky let it go let it go youll never see me cry here i stand and here ill stay let the storm rage onmy power flurries through the air into the ground my soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around and one thought crystallizes like an icy blast im never going back the past is in the pastlet it go let it go and ill rise like the break of dawn let it go let it go that perfect girl is gone here i stand in the light of day let the storm rage onthe cold never bothered me anyway

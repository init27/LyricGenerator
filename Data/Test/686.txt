 feeling my way through the darkness guided by a beating heart i cant tell where the journey will end but i know where to start they tell me im too young to understand they say im caught up in a dream well life will pass me by if i dont open up my eyes well thats fine by meso wake me up when its all over when im wiser and im older all this time i was finding myself and i didnt know i was lostso wake me up when its all over when im wiser and im older all this time i was finding myself and i didnt know i was losti tried carrying the weight of the world but i only have two hands i hope i get the chance to travel the world and i dont have any plans i wish that i could stay forever this young not afraid to close my eyes lifes a game made for everyone and love is a prizeso wake me up when its all over when im wiser and im older all this time i was finding myself and i didnt know i was lostso wake me up when its all over when im wiser and im older all this time i was finding myself and i didnt know i was losti didnt know i was lost i didnt know i was lost i didnt know i was lost i didnt know i was lost

some things we dont talk about rather do without and just hold the smile falling in and out of love ashamed and proud of together all the while you can never say never while we dont know when but time and time again younger now than we were before dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go picture youre the queen of everything far as the eye can see under your command i will be your guardian when all is crumbling ill steady your hand you can never say never while we dont know when but time time and time again younger now than we were before dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go were pulling apart and coming together again and again were growing apart but we pull it together pull it together together again dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go dont let me go

 when i was younger i saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind he broke his own heart and i watched as he tried to reassemble itand my momma swore that she would never let herself forget and that was the day that i promised id never sing of love if it does not exist but darlinyou are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exceptionmaybe i know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts and weve got to find other ways to make it alone but keep a straight faceand ive always lived like this keeping a comfortable distance and up until now i had sworn to myself that im content with lonelinessbecause none of it was ever worth the riskbut you are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exceptionive got a tight grip on reality but i cant let go of whats in front of me here i know your leaving in the morning when you wake up leave me with some kind of proof its not a dream ohyou are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exceptionyou are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exception you are the only exceptionand im on my way to believing oh and im on my way to believing

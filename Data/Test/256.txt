 ive been waiting for my dreams to turn into something i could believe in and looking for that magic rainbow on the horizon i couldnt see it until i let go gave into love and watched all the bitterness burn now im coming alive body and soul and feelin my world start to turnand ill taste every moment and live it out loud i know this is the time this is the time to be more than a name or a face in the crowd i know this is the time this is the time of my life time of my lifeholding onto things that vanished into the air left me in pieces but now im rising from the ashes finding my wings and all that i needed was there all along within my reach as close as the beat of my heartand ill taste every moment and live it out loud i know this is the time this is the time to be more than a name or a face in the crowd i know this is the time this is the time of my life time of my lifeand im out on the edge of forever ready to run im keeping my feet on the ground arms open wide face to the sunill taste every moment and live it out loud i know this is the time this is the time to be more than a name or a face in the crowd i know this is the time this is the time of my life time of my life more than a name or a face in the crowd this is the time this is the time of my life this is the time of my life time of my life time of my life

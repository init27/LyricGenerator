 i dont wanna be the girl who laughs the loudest or the girl who never wants to be alone i dont wanna be there calling 4 oclock in the morning cause im the only one you know in the world that wont be homeah the sun is blinding i stayed up again oh i am finding that thats not the way i want my story to endim safe up high nothing can touch me but why do i feel this partys over no pain inside youre my protection but how do i feel this good soberi dont wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence the quiet scares me cause it screams the truth please dont tell me that we had that conversation cause i wont remember save your breath cause whats the useah the night is calling and it whispers to me softly come and play but i i am falling and if i let myself go im the only one to blameim safe up high nothing can touch me but why do i feel this partys over no pain inside youre like perfection but how do i feel this good sobercoming down coming down coming down spinning round spinning round spinning round im looking for myself sober coming down coming down coming down spinning round spinning round spinning round looking for myself soberwhen its good then its good its so good till it goes bad till youre trying to find the you that you once had i have heard myself cry never again broken down in agony just tryin to find a friendoh ohim safe up high nothing can touch me but why do i feel this partys over no pain inside youre like perfection but how do i feel this good soberim safe up high nothing can touch me but why do i feel this partys over no pain inside youre like perfection but how do i feel this good sober
